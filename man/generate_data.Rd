\title{Generate Simulated Drug and Interaction Data}
\usage{
generate_data(n, p, seed = 123)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. The number of rows (samples) in the dataset.}

\item{p}{Integer. The number of main effects (predictors) in the dataset.}

\item{seed}{Integer. A seed value for random data generation to ensure reproducibility. Default is 123.}
}
\value{
A scaled dataframe containing the simulated main effects and two-way interactions,
with an additional intercept column.
}
\description{
This function simulates a dataset with specified main effects and interaction terms.
It first generates multivariate normal data for the main effects, and then computes
all possible two-way interaction effects between the predictors. The resulting data
is scaled by dividing each feature by its standard deviation (sd) to standardize the
values.
}
\details{
The function generates multivariate normal data for the main effects using a mean
vector of zeros and an identity covariance matrix. It then computes all two-way
interactions between these main effects and optionally scales the resulting dataset.
The output includes a column for the intercept, which is useful for regression models.
}
\examples{
# Generate a dataset with 100 samples and 10 main effects
data <- generate_data(n = 100, p = 10, seed = 123)
