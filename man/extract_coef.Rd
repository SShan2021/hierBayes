\title{Extract Coefficients from Hierarchical LASSO (HierLASSO) Model}
\usage{
extract_coef(ME, IE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ME}{Numeric vector. The main effects from the HierLASSO model.}

\item{IE}{Matrix. The interaction effects from the HierLASSO model. Only the lower triangular part of the matrix is considered for interactions.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{metric}: The names of the effects (e.g., "C1" for main effects, "C1C2" for interaction effects).
\item \code{value}: The corresponding coefficient values for the main and interaction effects.
}
}
\description{
This function extracts and formats the main effects and interaction effects from a Hierarchical LASSO (HierLASSO) model into a tidy dataframe.
The resulting dataframe includes metric names for both the main effects and interaction terms, along with their corresponding coefficient values.
}
\details{
The function constructs a dataframe by first extracting the main effects and labeling them with a "C" prefix (e.g., "C1" for the first main effect).
It then extracts interaction effects from the lower triangle of the interaction matrix (IE), assigning appropriate metric names (e.g., "C1C2" for an interaction between "C1" and "C2").

# Example usage:
ME <- c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)
IE <- matrix(c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0), nrow = 3)
results <- extract_coef(ME, IE)
print(results)
