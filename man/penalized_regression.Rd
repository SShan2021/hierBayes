\usage{
penalized_regression(
  df,
  family.value = "binomial",
  model.type = "lasso",
  max_lambda = 10,
  method = "CV",
  opt_lambda = "min"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe. The dataset containing both the outcome and predictor variables. The first column should be the outcome variable.}

\item{family.value}{Character. The type of regression model to fit. Default is "binomial".}

\item{model.type}{Character. The type of penalized regression to perform: "lasso", "ridge", or "elastic net". Default is "lasso".}

\item{max_lambda}{Numeric. The maximum value of lambda to try when using BIC for lambda selection. Default is 10.}

\item{method}{Character. The method used to select the optimal lambda: "CV" (cross-validation) or "BIC". Default is "CV".}

\item{opt_lambda}{Character. The lambda value to select when using cross-validation. "min" selects the lambda with minimum error, "1se" selects the lambda within one standard error of the minimum error. Default is "min".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{COEF}: A dataframe of the coefficients for the best penalized regression model.
\item \code{X}: The design matrix (covariates) used in the model.
\item \code{Y}: The outcome vector.
}
}
\description{
This function performs penalized regression using LASSO, Ridge, or Elastic Net. It supports
both cross-validation (CV) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) methods for selecting the
optimal lambda value. The function returns the best model and the coefficients of the fitted model.
}
\details{
This function fits a penalized regression model using \code{glmnet}. It supports three types of models:
\itemize{
\item LASSO (alpha = 1)
\item Ridge (alpha = 0)
\item Elastic Net (alpha between 0 and 1)
}
The user can choose to perform cross-validation (CV) or use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for selecting the optimal lambda.
For Elastic Net, the function iterates over a sequence of alpha values to find the best alpha-lambda combination.

# Example usage with binomial family and LASSO
data <- data.frame(outcome = rbinom(100, 1, 0.5), matrix(rnorm(1000), 100, 10))

print(results$COEF)
